    """
    Newton's Method is a method for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
    The process is repeated as:
    Xn+1 = Xn - f(Xn)/f'(Xn)
    Geometrically, (Xn+1, 0) is the intersection of the x-axis and the tangent of the graph of f at (Xn, fâ€‰(Xn)).
    
    In this case:
    f(t) = t^2 - x, sqrt(x) is the root of f(t)
